                    Clearly, the movement had a significant impact. The Redditors were victorious;
                    they shut down
                    hedge funds and made money. People also got a taste of the American financial system and witnessed
                    its downfalls.
                    Millions of new individuals started investing for their futures, but the pitfall of having such an
                    unregulated market
                    was ultimately recognized. How is it feasible for a stock's float to be shorted by more than 100%?
                    Some of these funds
                    were taking risks that I could never have imagined.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, I believe it is critical to use this as a stepping stone to the future. The SEC needs to do
                    a better job of
                    protecting the financial system and stop wasting taxpayers' money with these ineffective ads that
                    criminalize the retail
                    investors...

                    To make the markets more fair for the retail investor, Brokerages need to work on speedier
                    settlement
                    techniques. How is it possible for in 2022 it takes days for trades to settle?
                    Also, the SEC needs to make banks more transparent with large short positions on companies, making
                    the market fairer to
                    the
                    retail investor. The
                    market is already skewed against the retail investor, with institutions accounting for more than 85%
                    of trading volume.

                <h3>Is it possible that this will happen again?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is extremely improbable that an incident of this magnitude will occur again, as a stock being
                    shorted above 100% of
                    its float is extremely rare and risky. It might happen again, as it happened with Wolkswagen in late
                    2008 before GME but on a smaller scale.

                    Rather of hunting for the next short squeeze, educate yourself on financial literacy and how to save
                    for the future. The
                    stock market isn't a casino, and it shouldn't be treated that way. Learn how to invest wisely and
                    you will profit both
                    personally and financially.
